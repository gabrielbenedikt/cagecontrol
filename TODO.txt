-) Read controller feedback message to check that motor did not get stuck
-) Waveplate angles for circular: 22.5HWP, 0QWP
-) L/R buttons
-) Verify that 'go n steps' vs 'to to next edge, n times' does not make a difference
-) Extend documentation
-) Clean up GUI code
---) instead of "redwidget, brownwidget, greenwidget, ......", use QVector<widget>
-) Add UDP listener/sender to control software using UDP commands (or, use TCP. whatever)
-) Read bases from file
---) change every n seconds?
-) implement arbitrary unitaries using 3 waveplates
---) two controllers per cage, one shared between 2 cages -> logic needs to be altered (right now, it would attempt to open the serial comm to the shared controller twice - once per cage)
